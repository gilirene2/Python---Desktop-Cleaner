## 🔧 Dependencies
The project utilizes standard Python libraries and does not require any external dependencies.

## 📝 Notes
Python Libraries Used:
os: The os module provides a portable way of using operating system-dependent functionality. It is used in this project for tasks such as navigating the file system, working with file paths, and creating directories.

shutil: The shutil module offers a higher-level interface for file operations than the built-in os module. It is used in this project for moving files to appropriate folders.

Notes for Beginners:

- Understanding File Organization: Take a closer look at how files are organized into folders based on their file types using dictionaries and loops. Understanding this logic will help you grasp the fundamentals of file manipulation in Python.
- Reading and Writing Documentation: Explore the documentation for the os and shutil modules to understand their functionalities and usage. Learning how to read and understand documentation is an essential skill for Python developers.
- Experimentation and Exploration: Feel free to experiment with the code and make modifications to suit your requirements. This project serves as a starting point for learning Python scripting and can be expanded or customized according to your needs.
